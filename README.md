Abstract
Domestic violence, recognized as a global issue, transcends cultural, geographical, and socio-economic confines, affecting individuals irrespective of their background, especially women. Financial difficulties often act as a significant barrier for women facing domestic violence (DV), compelling them to remain in abusive situations. Despite the detrimental impact of DV on women's overall well-being, the link between financial independence and the risk of DV in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains largely underexplored in current literature. We aim to fill this gap by examining how women's financial autonomy correlates with DV in selected SSA countries. Utilizing data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), our findings reveal that an increase in financial autonomy (FA) is associated with a 1.9 percentage point decrease in the likelihood of experiencing DV. This association is particularly notable among women residing in urban areas. These results remain robust even when considering alternative women empowerment measures and other statistical methods. Our study underscores the significance of financial autonomy as a key factor in reducing the prevalence of DV, especially in rural settings.
